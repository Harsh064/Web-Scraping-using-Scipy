Banerjee's surprise visit to the protest side came days after the talks between protesting doctors and Banerjee failed to take place. No meeting was held as the Chief Minister said the meeting with the junior doctors could not be live-streamed as demanded by them because the issue is sub-judice and before the Supreme Court. Junior doctors have been protesting for the four consecutive day on Saturday outside Swasthya Bhawan, Salt Lake area, in West Bengal's Kolkata.

According to a Hindustan Times report, the  SIM card fraud  victim registered a complaint with the cybercrime police station, and an investigation has been initiated. Jyotsana Bhatia, a resident of  Noida  Sector 82, received a WhatsApp call from someone who pretended to be a telecom firm's customer care executive. The person explained to her a new feature of e-SIM that could be activated if her mobile phone got lost. Convinced by the call, the woman agreed to switch to an e-SIM and shared a code she had received on message with the person. The scammer also assured the woman that she would receive a physical sim in the next 2-3 days, but what happened next, left a lifelong impact on her life. Three days after the  SIM card  deactivation, the woman didn't receive a new SIM card, so she dialed the customer care number. \u201cWhen she did not receive the SIM card on September 1, she dialled customer care and was instructed to visit the service centre for a duplicate SIM,\u201d Vijay Kumar Gautam, station house officer (SHO), cybercrime branch, told Hindustan Times. The 44-year-old woman visited the service centre and got herself a new SIM card . When she activated her number, Bhatia received multiple messages of money deductions from her bank account. \u201cThe suspect broke my fixed deposit, siphoned off money from two bank accounts, and extended a loan of   \u20b9 7.40 lakh in my name without my knowledge,\u201d read Bhatia's statement in an FIR accessed by HT. Moreover, the suspect even accessed her mobile banking application through her mobile number. He also changed her email ID and carried out multiple transactions to debit money around   \u20b9 27 lakh. The police have registered a case and begun an investigation to nab the criminals. The woman ignored several red flags. The first one was a WhatsApp call by a customer care executive, which is very unlikely in real situations. It has been highly advised to not share any OTP or password to anyone on phone.\u00a0 -An eSIM is a digital SIM card which doesn't require the use of a physical chip for operation. People are always advised to switch to eSIM only after reading the process from an official website source or by meeting a telecom executive in person at the service centre. -Always verify the identity of anyone requesting sensitive information. -Be cautious of unsolicited calls or messages regarding new features or services. People need to be extra careful if the call has been made from applications like WhatsApp. -Regularly monitor bank accounts and report any suspicious activity immediately."},

However, the former president was fact-checked in real-time by the moderators of the debate, who rejected his claim, saying that there was no such evidence or complaint registered. Irked by the former US president\u2019s claim, the popular South African musician--known for turning odd internet moments into catchy songs--has composed a parody song on Trump's bizarre remark into a viral track, contrasting it with the sounds of cats and dogs. In the satirical song, Scott is urging the people of Springfield not to eat his cat and dog. The musician also suggests alternative food options. \u201cPeople of Springfield, please don\u2019t eat my cat/ why would you do that / eat something else,\u201d Scott sings. \u201cPeople of Springfield, please don\u2019t eat my dog/ here\u2019s a catalog of other things to eat,\u201d he added. This isn\u2019t the first time Trump\u2019s comments have triggered viral reactions online. Earlier, a Golden Retriever\u2019s animated response to Trump\u2019s claim also went viral, which left the internet in splits. The music video has already garnered over 6.5 million views, 71K likes, 2.6K comments on X, with fans praising the song as a hilarious fall \"banger\" and calling it \"brilliant.\""},

Of the 29 medals in India's kitty, 7 are gold, which is another first for the country that started to make its presence felt only in the 2016 edition, where it won four medals. In the upswing in performance, India had yielded 19 medals in Tokyo edition of Para-Olympics, a number that was surpassed this time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X (formerly Twitter) lauded the achievement of Indian para-athletes and attributed it to their unwavering dedication and indomitable spirit. \u201cParalympics 2024 have been special and historical. India is overjoyed that our incredible para-athletes have brought home 29 medals, which is the best-ever performance since India's debut at the Games,\" he said. \"This achievement is due to the unwavering dedication and indomitable spirit of our athletes. Their sporting performances have given us many moments to remember and inspired several upcoming athletes,\u201d Modi added.

Notably, the 29 medals have been achieved in a total of 5 sports, including a whopping 17 at the track and field events. The tally of 29 has ensured that India remains in the top 20 of the Paris Paralympics 2024. China has continued to dominate the game with over 200 medals. India has, however, beaten top nations like Switzerland, Belgium, South Korea, Turkey, and Argentina to secure its position. Pakistan , who were also competing win the event, ended the campaign at joint-bottom with Vietnam, Nepal and others at the 79th position, with just a solitary bronze to its name.

The likes of  Harvinder Singh  and Dharambir pushed India considerably higher up the medals tally by securing path-breaking gold medals in archery and club throw respectively.

As the  Indian cricket team  gears up for their upcoming Test series against Bangladesh, several notable developments have emerged.  Virat Kohli  makes a return to the Test squad after missing the five-Test series against England at home earlier this year. Kohli\u2019s comeback is highly anticipated, marking a significant boost for the team. Rishabh Pant, who was involved in a severe road accident on December 30, 2022, has also returned to top-flight cricket. Pant had played in the second and final Test against Bangladesh in Mirpur from December 22-25, 2022, but his road accident sidelined him until the IPL season of this year. He rejoined the national side during the  T20 World Cup , contributing to India\u2019s title-winning campaign. However, the selection news has not been uniformly positive. Mohammed Shami, despite initial expectations set by chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar, will not feature in the Test squad. Shami had been targeting a return for the first Test against  Bangladesh  but failed to secure a spot. On a more encouraging note, left-arm seamer Yash Dayal has received his maiden call-up to the Indian Test team for the opening match of the series. The Test series kicks off with the first of two Tests against Bangladesh in Chennai, starting September 19. The second Test will be held at the Green Park Stadium in Kanpur from September 27 to October 1. India and Bangladesh have faced each other in 13 Tests to date, with India emerging victorious in 11 matches and two ending in draws.

In contrast, India\u2019s last Test assignment was a convincing 4-1 series win over England at home earlier this year. The upcoming matches are expected to be a crucial test of form and strategy for both teams as they look to capitalize on their recent successes.

Sinner held aloft his arms in celebration after breaking Fritz to clinch the title and cheers rang around Arthur Ashe Stadium, even though home fans had hoped to see Fritz end a 21-year U.S. men's Grand Slam drought. Sinner was under a cloud of controversy at the start of the tournament after revelations that he tested positive twice for an anabolic agent in March but avoided a ban. An independent tribunal accepted his claim that the positive tests were the result of an unintentional contamination. The top seed blocked out the furore in New York and with the win claimed his second Grand Slam title after winning the Australian Open earlier this year. \"We just went day-by-day, trying to practice well, even on the days off, believing in ourselves which is the most important. I understood, especially in this tournament, how important the mental part is in this sport,\" said Sinner. \"I would like to thank everyone for being so fair in this amazing arena. It was a huge pleasure.\" Fritz got off to a dreadful start when he handed Sinner the break with an unforced error in the first game but settled his nerves, breaking back in the fourth game and surviving a 23-shot rally - the longest of the match - to save break point in the fifth. But it was only a matter of time before the Italian would hit his stride and he broke the 12th seeded American with a perfectly placed drop shot in the seventh game. Fritz dropped his serve again on set point when he sent a backhand beyond the baseline, one of 34 unforced errors that cost him dearly across the match. The fired up home crowd that included pop megastar Taylor Swift tried to lift Fritz with chants of \"USA!\" in the second set, as he worked to get some traction in his first major final. PILED ON THE MISERY However, the momentum swung in Sinner\u2019s direction as he broke Fritz on set point from the baseline, sending a sublime backhand down the line that the American was unable to return. He piled further misery on Fritz when he clawed back from triple break point down in the opening game of the third set, holding his serve with an overhead smash, a fine effort that even the U.S. fans applauded. Fritz clung on and even went up a break but was left smacking his racket onto the court in frustration when he hit a volley into the net to let Sinner break back in the 10th. Sinner broke for a sixth time in the contest to wrap up the win, with Fritz swiping a forehand into the net on match point. \"Here was difficult because also the pretournament circumstances weren't easy,\" said Sinner, who climbed the stands to celebrate with his team as fans shouted \"Bravo!\" around him. \"I felt like that I have grown, you know, match by match and that my confidence level went higher and higher.\" With U.S. great Andre Agassi on court for the presentation ceremony, Fritz told the crowd: \"I know we\u2019ve been waiting for a champion for a long time so I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t get it done this time. But I\u2019m gonna keep working and hopefully I\u2019ll get it the next time.\" It was a fresh disappointment for U.S. fans, after home hope Jessica Pegula lost to Aryna Sabalenka in the women's final. The win capped a blockbuster year for Sinner, who came back from two sets down to triumph at Melbourne Park and won in Miami and Cincinnati. The world number one leaves New York with an impressive 55-5 win-loss record for the year, leaving rivals in his wake as Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz crashed out early. It was not all good news for Sinner, however, as it became clear the doping controversy could linger well after he leaves, as he continued to answer questions about the saga as he sat at a post-match press conference with the trophy. Some members of the media and his own fellow players have alleged a double standard in how he was treated and Sinner said he had difficulty enjoying the tournament at times. \"What I can say is that the general reaction of the players was quite positive, even when things came out. Then there have been, of course, some different voices, but this is in everything,\" he said. \"That's why you have, as I said before, the people close to you, these are the people who knows what was going on and what I and my team went through.\" (Reporting by Amy Tennery in New York, additional reporting by Karl Plume in New York and Frank Pingue in Toronto, editing by Pritha Sarkar and Michael Perry)"},

Despite no rain, the skippers of both teams haven't even turned up for the toss, reported news agency  PTI . The reason is that the stadium is ill-equipped to handle a Test match. Now, the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) members are visibly upset with the conditions, and a few of them swear never to return to the venue again. \"This is a huge mess; we are never coming back here. The players are also unhappy with the facilities here. We had spoken with the concerned people well in advance and were assured by the stadium guys that everything will be in order (pertaining to the media facilities),\"  HT  quoted an ACB official as saying. While another added, \"Nothing has changed since we came here. It's not improved one bit.\" The Greater Noida stadium is Afghanistan's home ground. The ICC in 2016 gave the stadium the go-ahead to host full member games, and following this, Afghanistan hosted two ODIs and T20Is each between 2017 and 2020. Match referee Javagal Srinath's report on Greater Noida Stadium's preparedness will decide the venue's fate in the coming days. The  ICC 's 'Pitch and Outfield Monitoring Process' rules, which came into effect in November 2023, say, \u201cAfter each Match, the Match Referee (Srinath in this case) will complete a Pitch and Outfield Report Form and send it to the ICC Senior Cricket Operations Manager.\u201d The 'Pitch and Outfield Report Form' will be compiled using the ICC guidelines for rating pitches and outfields. It may also include comments on the pitch and outfield from the captains of the two teams that played the match. It will be interesting to see how New Zealand skipper Tim Southee comments on the situation. After the receipt is submitted in 14 days, the ICC senior cricket operations manager will forward the 'Pitch and Outfield Report Form' to the home board and a copy to the visiting board. After this, the ICC senior cricket operations manager will advise the home board on any demerit points \u2013 imposed on a host venue that will remain active for a rolling five-year period. According to ICC clause, \"If the conditions are such that the Match Referee has cause to rate the pitch and/or outfield Unsatisfactory or Unfit, a corresponding number of Demerit Points will be imposed upon the Host Venue as outlined in the guidelines for rating pitches and outfields.\" In case of Greater Noida venue accumulates a total of six or more demerit points, its accreditation to host international matches will be suspended for a period of 12 months, report says. However, ICC rules say that if both pitch and outfield are deemed 'unfit' by match referee for a Test match, then it would get three demerit points and it would take one more such game to get the venue suspended. After the demerit points, the ACB would have to decide whether to continue playing at the Greater Noida Stadium. In case Greater Noida gets demerit points, local authorities would need the BCCI's deep pockets to make it at least a palatable domestic venue. Earlier,  the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)  had allowed ACB to choose between Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru and Green Park in Kanpur. But ACB chose a cost-effective venue. Since the Vijay Hazare Trophy in 2019, the BCCI has not hosted any of its domestic games in Greater Noida and may not host another one in the distant future due to citing substandard conditions.

In August, the CAS had in a statement to confirm that, \"The application field by  Vinesh Phogat  on August 7 has been dismissed.\" In August, Indian Olympic Association (IOA) advocate Vidushpat Singhania told news agency ANI that the CAS's decision can be appealed to the Swiss Federal Tribunal within 30 days. After Vinesh Phogat claimed that her lawyers had been 'lenient' with the appeal against disqualification case which cost her a Paris Olympics medal, top lawyer Harish Salve has echoed Singhania's statement and said the he 'got the impression' that Phogat did not want to move further with the case. Talking to  TimesNow , Harish Salve said, \"\u201cLater on, we got everything and we fought hard. In fact, I even offered the lady that maybe we can challenge it in the Swiss court of appeal against the arbitration award but I was told by the lawyers that my impression is she didn\u2019t want to carry this any further\". Vinesh Phogat  also alleged that the hospital picture of her and IOA president PT Usha was coerced and unconsented. Harish Salve also alleged that there was a lack of coordination on the end of Vinesh Phogat's lawyers. \u201cThere was a complete lack of coordination, lack of cohesion for quite some time initially. That\u2019s because the very good law firm which had been engaged by the Indian Olympic Association was told by some lawyers who the athlete ( Vinesh Phogat ) had engaged that \u2018we will not share anything with you, we will not give anything to you. It was very late we got everything, he added. Vinesh Phogat recently announced her retirement from wrestling and has since joined the Congress party. The party has nominated her as their candidate for the Julana seat in the upcoming Haryana assembly elections."},

The move from the opposition party comes as the latest development amongst the earlier claims against SEBI Chief  Buch , accusing her of impropriety, as per the report. The spokesperson, while addressing a press conference, talked about the transactions taking place between 2017 and 2023, when Buch was a Whole-time Member of SEBI and then its Chairperson, said the report. \u201cThese transactions are a  violation  of Section 6 of SEBI Code on Conflict of Interest for Members of Board (2008),\u201d said Khera. \u201cWe want to know when and which govt agency Buch informed about these assets. We want to know when was the first time Buch declared these  foreign  assets, and which govt agency she informed, and when,\u201d he said, according to the report. Khera named Global X MSCI China Consumer (CHIQ) and Invesco China Technology ETF (CQQQ) two funds out of the four in which Buch was allegedly invested in, as per the report.\u00a0 This move from Congress came one day after SEBI Chief Buch and her husband, Dhaval Buch, issued a detailed statement that addressed the list of allegations put against them. The allegations range from consulting assignments taken on by Buch's husband after his  retirement  while Madhabi Puri Buch was at SEBI to their firm Agora Advisory, in which she allegedly owns a 99 per cent stake, receiving payments from listed companies including Mahindra Group, Pidilite, and Dr Reddy's Labs, according to the report. The allegations also said that she and her husband received rental income from a company related to Wockhardt, and raised questions about the receipt of payments from ICICI Banks years after she left, as per the report. Buch and her husband, in a joint statement, termed the allegations as \u201cfalse, incorrect,  malicious  and motivated.\u201d She also accused the opposition party of practice of levelling false allegations in installments, saying it was an attempt \u201conly to keep the pot boiling,\u201d according to the news portal. \u201cWe are questioning why you were lying when you said Agora was a dormant company when it wasn't. It was getting consultancy\u2026 The other lie was Madhabi Buch saying that she didn't know that she was renting her property to someone related to Wockhardt,\" he claimed, as per the report. Congress asked three questions to Buch and the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party ( BJP ) government, according to a platform X post by Jairam Ramesh, general secretary in-charge of communications for Congress.\u00a0 The questions ranged from asking about whether or not the Prime Minister (PM) is aware of SEBI Chief \u201ctrading in listed securities while in possession of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information,\u201d to asking about PM's awareness of Buch's investment outside  India  and its date and disclosures. They also asked about Buch's investment in Chinese companies amid geopolitical issues, as per the post.\u00a0 The Congress party rejected the explanations given by Buch, ICICI Bank, Mahindra Group, Pidilite etc issued to counter Congress' earlier allegations as being insufficient. They have maintained their stance about the payments made by these firms to Buch or entities linked to her as violations of SEBI's Code on Conflict of Interest for Members of Board (2008), according to the news portal."},

They argued that their request was reasonable, given that parliamentary discussions and many administrative meetings are broadcast live. The doctors expressed frustration over being asked to leave electronic gadgets outside the meeting hall, which prevented them from recording the proceedings. The second-year postgraduate medical student was raped and murdered inside the seminar hall of RG Kar Medical College on August 9."},

According to the Hindu legends, after Indra is defeated by  King Mahabali , the devas ultimately seek refuge in Vishnu, who agrees to restore Indra to power. To do so, Vishnu incarnates as a dwarf priest called Vamana and requests only three feet (steps) of land to build a fire-altar. Mahabali agrees. Vamana grows in size, and in three strides, encompasses all of the universe and beyond. The three worlds are restored to Indra, and Mahabali and the asuras are banished to the netherworld. However, witnessing Mahabali's love for his subjects, Vamana grants the king's sole wish to visit his kingdom once every year. Onam is celebrated on Dwadashi Tithi of Shukla Paksha in the month of Bhadrapada, under Shravana Nakshatra. This year, the grand harvest festival falls on Sunday, September 15. Onam also marks the beginning of the Malayalam calendar year \u2013  Kolla Varsham .

After the chief minister concluded her speech and left the site, the agitating doctors said they were not ready to compromise on their demands till discussions were held. Banerjee's surprise visit to the protest side came days after the talks between protesting doctors and Banerjee failed to take place. No meeting was held as the Chief Minister said the meeting with the junior doctors could not be live-streamed as demanded by them because the issue is sub-judice and before the Supreme Court. Junior doctors have been protesting for the four consecutive day on Saturday outside Swasthya Bhawan, Salt Lake area, in West Bengal's Kolkata.

According to a Hindustan Times report, the  SIM card fraud  victim registered a complaint with the cybercrime police station, and an investigation has been initiated. Jyotsana Bhatia, a resident of  Noida  Sector 82, received a WhatsApp call from someone who pretended to be a telecom firm's customer care executive. The person explained to her a new feature of e-SIM that could be activated if her mobile phone got lost. Convinced by the call, the woman agreed to switch to an e-SIM and shared a code she had received on message with the person. The scammer also assured the woman that she would receive a physical sim in the next 2-3 days, but what happened next, left a lifelong impact on her life. Three days after the  SIM card  deactivation, the woman didn't receive a new SIM card, so she dialed the customer care number. \u201cWhen she did not receive the SIM card on September 1, she dialled customer care and was instructed to visit the service centre for a duplicate SIM,\u201d Vijay Kumar Gautam, station house officer (SHO), cybercrime branch, told Hindustan Times. The 44-year-old woman visited the service centre and got herself a new SIM card . When she activated her number, Bhatia received multiple messages of money deductions from her bank account. \u201cThe suspect broke my fixed deposit, siphoned off money from two bank accounts, and extended a loan of   \u20b9 7.40 lakh in my name without my knowledge,\u201d read Bhatia's statement in an FIR accessed by HT. Moreover, the suspect even accessed her mobile banking application through her mobile number. He also changed her email ID and carried out multiple transactions to debit money around   \u20b9 27 lakh. The police have registered a case and begun an investigation to nab the criminals. The woman ignored several red flags. The first one was a WhatsApp call by a customer care executive, which is very unlikely in real situations. It has been highly advised to not share any OTP or password to anyone on phone.\u00a0 -An eSIM is a digital SIM card which doesn't require the use of a physical chip for operation. People are always advised to switch to eSIM only after reading the process from an official website source or by meeting a telecom executive in person at the service centre. -Always verify the identity of anyone requesting sensitive information. -Be cautious of unsolicited calls or messages regarding new features or services. People need to be extra careful if the call has been made from applications like WhatsApp. -Regularly monitor bank accounts and report any suspicious activity immediately.", "Published Date": null},
